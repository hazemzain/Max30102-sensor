# Max30102-sensor
Interfacing the MAX30102 pulse-oximeter with NUCLEO-G474RE Board.
(max30102) A pulse oximeter is basically a device which can measure your pulse and oxygen saturation in your blood. 
Usually this sensor consists of two LEDs emitting light: one in Red spectrum (650nm) and the other one in Infrared (950nm). This sensor is placed on your finger or earlobe, essentially anywhere where the skin is not too thick so both light frequencies can easily penetrate the tissue. Once both of them are shined through your finger for example, the absorption is measure with a photodiode. And depending on the amount of oxygen you have in your blood the ratio between the absorbed red light and IR led will be different. From this ratio it is possible to “easily” calculate your oxygen level in your hemoglobinUsually this sensor consists of two LEDs emitting light: one in Red spectrum (650nm) and the other one in Infrared (950nm).
